     GAME OUTLINE

     It's autumn, and you live in a log cabin and need to collect enough wood to survive the winter.  You have to
     venture out into the forest to collect enough wood to survive.  You have won once you've gathered five
     logs of wood into your home.  The wood has to be of oak specifically; nothing else will burn right for
     your preferences.

     GAMEPLAY

        -north (n), south (s), east (e), west (w): attempt to move to a location in
         one of those directions

Some hosting was set up, now the bot runs on it's own.  It doesn't do anything
interesting yet, aside from host the demo game.  At least the demo game is
functional for now.

Now I have to figure out how to store/load a game from the database, as well as
how to store a running game state locally, so that when a player starts playing
again, they'll be able to pick up where they left off.

TODO: TokenSelector.py needs to have some way of taking the bot token from the
command line, instead of going through the awful GUI.

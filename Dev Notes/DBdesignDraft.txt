DB DESIGN DETAILS

The database needs to, at a minimum, have a record of the game state for every
uesr that logs into discord.

GAME STATE

The game state needs to track the following details:
    -Player character sheet/stats
    -Player inventory
    -Player location
    -All rooms in the game
    -Contents of the rooms
    -NPCs in the rooms
    -Any set flags in the rooms

All rooms and objects are just objects.  So to implement the whole world,

Just make a list of objects that relate to one another in a certain way.

Objects and rooms are the same thing.


GAME OBJECT STRUCTURE

It's all about the concept of "containment"

There is a "root" object called "offscreen".  All "rooms" have "offscreen" as it's parent.

GAME TABLE
-Every room and object has an entry in the "master game table".

For the adventure game parser, you need tables for the following concepts:

ARTICLES (A, AN, THE)
PREPOSITIONS (IN, ON, UNDER, OVER, AT, WITH)
DICTIONARY (OLD, RUSTY, IRON, SWORD)
VERBS (GET, TAKE, PICK UP, LOOK AT, X, LOOK) (CAN BE A LITTLE DIFFERENT, you have synonyms for verbs, associating specific IDs.

ObjectWordTable: This is

Jump Tables (maps user input to subroutines)

String Tables (for names, descriptions, messages)

PARSING

1) clean up input (uppercase, remove articles)

2) identify parts of speech

3) Verify the words entered are in the game's dictionary

sample sentence 1:
    -Pick up the iron sword
    1) CONVERT TO UPPERCASE
       PICK UP THE IRON SWORD
    2) REMOVE ARTICLES
        PICK UP IRON SWORD
    3) Look up Verb ID in the Verb Table
        {PICK UP} IRON SWORD  [In this case, "PICK UP" is identified as a verb]

    4) IDENTIFY DIRECT OBJECT OF VERB
        PICK UP {IRON SWORD}
        Is "IRON" in the dictionary?

sample sentence 2:
    REMOVE FROMITZ BOARD WITH SHINY PLIERS
    {REMOVE} = VERB 10
    {FROMITZ} = OBJ 3
    {WITH} = PREP 4
    {SHINY} = OBJ 12

By using the combination 10,3,4,12, you are (somehow) able to learn about "subroutine" (function) "remove_fromitz_sub",
which does something in game.


DISAMBIGUATION
How do you disambiguate when given ambiguous input?  For example, typing "get key", but there are multiple keys.
Associate a "score" with each object, and whichever one is highest score, use that one.

if word doesn't map to an object, set it's score to 0
if object isn't visible, set score to 0

"selfdeletion.py" was written to model moving 'contained' objects from one 'container' to
another, to better understand how players/rooms interact with each other, as well as how
classes/instances/class variable vs. instance variables in Python work.

Current problem: linking rooms together

SOLUTION: Implement world as a 2d list of rooms.  Every room will have it's north, south,
east, and west sides set to "open" or "closed".  Additionally, a "wrapper" class for
rooms, called an "exit", will be used for any additional exits not covered by
these concepts (can represent trap-doors in floors, ceilings, "portals", or other
passageways not cleanly representable by NESW paths).
